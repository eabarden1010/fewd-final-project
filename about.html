		<h4>About</h4>
		<p>This section is going to be all about Kirk. He or I need to write something up about him. Ask what he would like to include and exclude. I want to extend this section enough to see what it looks like when it goes beyond the picture. If it wraps around, maybe start a new paragraph with a seperating p tag. If that looks weird, then maybe move the picture to the bottom of the page, so maybe the bottom left. I wonder if I should put a border at the top of the section tags but it might conflict with the border lines within the aside section tag. </br></br></br> I can try it and see but I don't know that it would make much sense to add that feature. Check out more templates to see what they use.--This section is going to be all about Kirk. He or I need to write something up about him. Ask what he would like to include and exclude.
