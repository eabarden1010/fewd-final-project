			<h4>Tombs</h4><div class="small-line-list">___</div><div class="post-date-list">April 21, 2015</div>
			<p><p class="section-p">I was just a boy the first time I heard the tales of the tomb city. Mama had taken me to the bazaar and I wandered among the smells of roasting meat, fresh spices and sweat, entranced by the sights and sounds of people from all over the world. Blonde haired, blue eyed men from the North, their faces scorched a deep and angry red by the merciless desert sun, the dark skinned merchants in their green robes from the far South and every imaginable shade and location in between, a great stew of humanity. I reveled in it, borne along through the crowd by the slender, gentle hand of my mother.
            
                  </br></br>She stopped to gossip with one of her friends and I slipped away into the current of jostling bodies, unnoticed. I shuffled aimlessly from stall to stall, enjoying the sounds of commerce: merchants hawking wares in a dozen different languages, men and women haggling over the price of some piece of meat or pottery as others looked on. As a child, I was invisible to most of the adults, a short obstacle to be ignored or stumbled over. A voice, deep and a bit ragged called out from the smoky interior of a stall.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;Boy! Come here.&rdquo;

            
                  <br></br>I turned, squinting through the haze into the shop of an incense seller. Two dark eyes and something gold glittered out at me through the gloom of the stall&rsquo;s interior. Looking around dumbly, I turned back to the merchant.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;Me, sir?&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>The glint of gold beneath those piercing eyes again.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;Yes, you, boy. Come in. I am bored of making no sales and have stories to tell.&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>I looked around for my mother. After a few panicked seconds, I spotted her, still deep in gossip with her friend. I turned and entered the richly scented stall.
            
                  <br></br>He was a thin, dark skinned man in a loose fitting shirt and cracked leather vest. What other items of clothing he wore, I cannot say, as he never emerged from behind his counter. Chains of gold glittered from the open v of his collar, and a gold tooth winked at me from the top row of his teeth whenever the man smiled.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good boy. Nice of you to indulge a weary and bored old merchant on a hot, slow day such as this. Tell me true, boy. Have you ever heard tell of the Tomb City?&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>I shook my head. The merchant nodded slightly, as if confirming this to himself.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;Well it is a sad tale, but one worth the telling. That is, should you want to hear it.&rdquo; He leaned forward expectantly on the counter, the braided gold rattling against his bony chest.
            
                  </br></br>I nodded my assent.
            
			</br></br>The gold tooth flashed again.
            
                  </br></br>&ldquo;Very good. You may want to take a seat, boy. This is no short tale.&rdquo; A long fingered hand indicated the battered and balding rug before the counter. I took one last look over my shoulder at my mother and then stepped forward, sitting cross legged on the rug. The man ignited another stick of his wares, the smoke tracing lazy, drunken lines in the air before his face, his words scented with tinges of clove and cinnamon.
            
                  </br></br>&ldquo;The Tomb City once had a name, long ago. But it was lost to memory, along with its people and location. The city was ruled by a just and wise man, King Zydmainados. He was much beloved by his people. The city was a marvel to behold, and was a great center of trade and learning. As you can imagine, the ruler of such a place was beset with innumerable offers of marriage to the daughters of powerful men, each seeking to improve his position in the world. But King Zydmainados refused them all, instead devoting himself to his people, rather than the political machinations of men lusting after greater glory and control over the city. Still, every day they came. And every day King Zydmainados turned them away.
            
                  </br></br>She came one day to his court, hair afire with some inner light, like the last rays of the sunset as it clings desperately to the horizon. She had come to speak of the plight of her brother, presumed captured by bandits on a trading mission some months before. The king listened, enraptured by the woman&rsquo;s voice and passion writ plain across her face. When she had finished, the king dispatched soldiers to find the woman&rsquo;s brother and invited her to join him at his evening meal as his guest.
            
                  </br></br>The woman was taken aback by the invitation, but acquiesced after a brief moment of hesitation. What began that evening in the audience chamber blossomed into a love affair that moved the pens of poets and the tongues of bards. The city flourished, drawing visitors from across the land to visit its bazaars and halls of learning.
            
                  </br></br>Then, one day, the king summoned the greatest of the city&rsquo;s renowned artisans and builders, He looked ashen, great dark circles beneath his once bright eyes, which were now oddly dull. He commanded them to begin work on a tomb, to be erected west of the city, a great and beautiful tribute to his love. The artisans solemnly agreed, and construction began. A pall of mourning hung over the city, its people too feeling the deep loss experienced by their beloved king. He began to withdraw from the public eye, holding fewer audiences. The king was not seen for days at a time, the day to day running of the city left to a small council of trusted advisors. Word began to spread among the people about lights glimpsed in the unfinished tomb late at night, some even going so far as to say that they had seen the king himself wandering among the columns of the soaring monument. A year passed in this way, the rumors becoming more widespread, and the king seen even less by his people. The great tomb was completed, but the king did not appear to inspect it. It was said a procession of dark robed figures bore a black shrouded coffin into the tomb in the dead of night, but details differed too much among the various accounts for anyone to put too much stock in their words.
            
                  </br></br>The council of advisors continued to run the city, but things were never the same. Voices once raised in praise of justice and innovation now began to whisper of avarice and apathy. And then the king summoned together artisans. He demanded a newer, grander tomb be constructed. The artisans were taken aback by this, but complied nonetheless. As construction on the new tomb began, the whispers of discontent in the city grew louder. Years passed. Two new tombs rose to flank the original. The king was only seen by a handful of his advisors, who urged him to abandon his solitude and retake the reins of his city. Still consumed by his grief, the king refused to listen and the city began its slow decline into despair and decay. Corruption and decadence found their way inside of the once great walls and began to stain the noble soul of all King Zydmainados had worked to create. The king himself disappeared completely, his continued existence only hinted at by the lights glimpsed among the ever growing tomb complex that had begun to edge closer and closer to the city.
            
                  </br></br>As the years passed, the transformation from a center of enlightenment and trade to the darkest pit of the criminal world became complete. Elicit and dark magicks were well known to be readily available for purchase in the shops and back alleys of the city. People left in droves as the thieves, warlocks and assassins poured in to ply their vile trades.  And still the tomb complex grew. It had become its own small city, silent spires reaching into the sky like accusing fingers. No one knew (or truly cared) about how the tombs continued to be built. Dark deals made with darker forces was the prevailing theory. By this time, all of King Zydmainados&rsquo; council of advisors were long moldering in their graves, and the city barely resembled its original self. The soul of the city was corrupted, infested with an evil that ate away at it like the thousand gnawing fangs of cancer. It began to consume itself, decay and abandonment blossoming everywhere. Eventually the city stood empty, the drifts of sand creeping in to drown it beneath the desert, another sunken and vanished myth whispered of in the later hours among old men and into the ears of dozing children before sleep. Even at the end, people still spoke of seeing lights in the tombs deep into the night. It was widely accepted King Zydmainados haunted the tombs, and as the city entered its death throes, it was apparent that it would all become one great tomb, a testament to the merciless and engulfing grip of lover and loss. It was lost, a perfect reflection of the man who once ruled.&rdquo;
            
                  </br></br>It took me a moment to realize that the incense seller had finished his story. The words haunted me, clinging to my mind like the cloying smoke in the air. Shouts from the bazaar brought me back to reality, and I rushed out of the stall as the sound of my mother&rsquo;s cries reached my ears. Mama scolded me shamefully in front of a crowd of people who had been attracted by her panicked shouts, and my father did more than scold me when he returned home that night. But none of that mattered. I dreamt of the city that night for the first time, but it would not be the last.

	           </br></br>*  *  *</br>

                  </br></br>I reined in my camel as we crested the gravelly rise. It grunted in the instinctively annoyed way of which only camels are capable. Shading my eyes against the sinking sun, I glimpsed the grasping fingers against a sky on fire. I made camp that night within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the crumbling walls, though not near enough to glimpse the tombs. Once or twice over the course of the night I swore I had seen a strange green light within some of the distant spires, though I managed to convince myself by morning that it was merely the excited fabrication of an exhausted mind, drunk with the euphoria of discovery. I broke camp and led my obstinate travel partner beneath the once breathtaking arch of the main gate, the sightless eyes of statues worn by time and sands staring out of nearly featureless faces. Tethering the camel to a partially collapsed column, I proceeded to make my way through the sand-choked and ruined streets. I had my pack and enough supplies for three days, if I was sparing with my water. Thrust through my belt was my father&rsquo;s dagger, though I feared no spirits or ghouls as I explored the mummified corpse of the city that had haunted my dreams every night since that day in the bazaar, some thirty years prior.
            
                  <br></br>I wandered among the ruins, delving deep into the sunken courtyards and cellars not yet swallowed by the creeping sand. In one such place, the sun&rsquo;s rays spilled through a skylight, revealing an intricate design cut into the smooth stone of the floor. I noticed some rust colored stains as I stepped over the wheeling, intersecting arcs, but I didn&rsquo;t give them much thought. Determined to explore the shadowed chambers beyond, I continued on. The light from the previous room barely penetrated into the two that adjoined it, so I was forced to light my lantern. Ancient, crumbling rushes that may have once comprised a mat disintegrated beneath my boots as I crossed the floor, lantern held high. Deep stone shelves held an array of glass bottles, their contents long since reduced to dust. I spent some time carefully examining some of the books I found there, whose pages crumbled at the slightest touch. Cryptic symbols written in a crabbed hand were found on the remains of every page, and I saw little chance of their secrets ever being deciphered, so I left them to molder on their shelves.
            
                  <br></br>Leaving the room with the books and bottles behind, I noted that the light from the other room had begun to shift. The design carved into the floor was now better illuminated, and I could see symbols similar to those found in the books inscribed around the design&rsquo;s circular outer edge. The rushes on the floor had become more visible as well, and they revealed themselves to be not rushes, but thin bones whose origins I did not choose to guess at. Gingerly stepping over the bones and the seal, I made my way back into the streets, less curious about the shadow shrouded staircase I had glimpsed at the back of the rearmost chamber in the apartment.
            
                  <br></br>I still had no fear of anything lurking among the buildings, it was the profound feeling of emptiness that precluded the extensive explorations of the city I had originally planned. Besides, I had come to see the tombs, those great reaching monuments whose construction had caused the decline and eventual desolation of both the city and its ruler.
            
                  <br></br>I made camp that night in the great square outside the broken gates of the palace, my fire the only light and warmth for untold miles around. Something was tugging at my mind, something I had notice repeatedly throughout the day but couldn&rsquo;t quite recall. It made my sleep restless and I finally rose some time deep into the night to relieve myself. I had stopped about ten paces or so from the ring of firelight when I could have sworn I saw that ghostly green light moving in one of the high windows of the palace. When I looked again, it was gone.
            
                  <br></br>I was awake early the next morning and picked my way up the cracked and crumbling palace steps as the sun broke over the city walls. According to one of the handful of accounts I had managed to unearth about the city, the sole entrance to the tombs was found within the apartments of King Zydmainados. As I made my way through the remains of the palace, I could glimpse the splendor and majesty of the place before its ruler was consumed by grief. The intricate patterns worked into the stone floor, the mosaics and frescoes whose faded and peeling colors merely hinted at the artistry and thought that had been put into their creation.
            
                  <br></br>Eager to reach the tombs before the sun reached its zenith, I continued on, trying to navigate the sweeping halls and broken stairwells towards where I believed the apartments of the king lay. As I moved deeper into the palace, I could feel something, some primal urge dragging me on. I knew, somehow, that I was headed in the right direction. The feeling began to grow from a faint whisper in my mind to a shout, and when I found myself standing before a set of intricately carved doors, seemingly untouched by the ravaging fingers of looters and decay, I knew I had found the chambers of the king.
            
                  <br></br>The ease with which the doors opened caused a twinge of alarm somewhere deep within my mind, but the thrill of discovery all but completely drowned it out. The king&rsquo;s apartment was a wreck, the hangings torn from the walls, the furniture smashed, left to rot in broken heaps throughout the chambers. The archways that connected the rooms were smooth as glass, as if some great thing had continually squeezed its bulk through them over the course of hundreds of years. There were wide swaths of the floor that matched the arches, and I followed one of these paths through the rooms until I found a great yawning hole cut into one of the walls. Approaching it, I could see a great stone staircase spiraling down into the darkness. The steps were smooth as glass, and I trod upon them with great care, as I knew one false step could mean the loss of my lantern, or worse yet, a headlong plunge into darkness. I made my way down into the blackness for what felt like hours, but I knew it could only be minutes. I began to see softening in the darkness below me, and as I made yet another turn on the treacherous steps, sunlight burst into view at the end of a long hallway. I was nearly blinded by the sun as I emerged from the passage, and as my vision returned I gasped at what lay before my dazzled eyes. I was standing on a wide causeway that connected the tunnel to a sprawling expanse of tombs, a city even greater than the one of legend I had left behind, cyclopean monoliths of stone stretching skeletal fingers towards the sun. When I regained my composure, I started across the causeway, noting the angle of the sun above my head. The bridge led directly into the great, intricately carved archway of the first tomb, which looked as if it had been erected only yesterday. The arch opened into a room with a beautifully tiled floor, a massive, spiraling design of green and blue tiles each no bigger than my thumbnail set into the black surface. A staircase snaked its way up the exterior walls, nearly invisible unless glimpsed at just the correct angle. I ascended, ignoring the complaints from my back and legs. Emerging into the sunlight, I found myself in a room with four ornate arches open to the north, south, east and west. In the center of the room was a dais of white marble, upon which lay a beautiful coffin inlaid with gold and precious stones. The room offered breathtaking views of the sprawling city of monuments and I stood for a long time, speechless at the artistry and vastness of what lay before me.
            
                  <br></br>I spent the rest of that day exploring the surrounding tombs, each connected by a series of bridges and causeways. The time put into each minute detail was staggering. It must have taken great teams of builders and artisans years to craft each one. While each of the tombs I entered was unique from its neighbor in terms of style and craft, they all shared one characteristic--the ornate and beautiful coffin found in an open room at the pinnacle. The majesty of the place was dwarfed only by the crippling sense of loss that hung over it all.  Of all the stories I heard, the accounts I had read, none could adequately describe that feeling. And even as I experienced it, I could not find a way to put it into words. It weighed upon my soul.
            
                  <br></br>I camped that night on one of the causeways, but I lit no fire, feeling that such a profane act would blaspheme this sacred place. The night was clear, and the moon and stars illuminated the monuments, giving them the appearance of polished ivory and bone. I stood on the causeway, unable to sleep, still marveling at my surroundings. It was then that I saw the green light again, flitting among the open top of a nearby tomb. This time it did not disappear when I looked, dancing before my disbelieving eyes. There seemed to be some disturbance in the air around the light, like a heat shimmer around a flame. The night sky around it was muddled, unfocused. Then the light disappeared. I swallowed, frozen where I stood. Scanning the surrounding tombs for a sign of the light proved fruitless. A breeze sprang up, I could hear it whistling through the open doorways and arches around me. I pulled my cloak tighter around my shoulders. Finally able to move, I fumbled for my lantern, anything to soften the cold light from above. The sound of the wind grew louder as I attempted to get it lit.
            
                  <br></br>The rushing sound stopped almost as quickly as it began, and I raised my lantern. There was nothing else on the causeway. I relaxed a bit, until I looked up towards the top of the nearest tomb. The green light blazed down at me, surrounded again by that eerie, shimmering disturbance. I could see the stone of the tomb and the night sky through the shimmer, but they were muted, somehow duller. Somehow I managed to raise my lantern, but its weak light did little at that distance. I stood, transfixed as the light began to move down the side of the tomb. As it descended, I began to realize what I seeing. The shimmer was a great amorphous body, nearly transparent. The point of light was the eye of this great thing. My mind screamed out at my legs to move, but I was frozen. As it drew nearer, I could make out long fingered, grasping hands at the end of bulging, powerful arms. The thing was crawling down the tomb headfirst and it was not long before it reached the causeway. It lowered itself back on its haunches, squatting like a great ghostly toad. I could see through its massive bulk, everything behind it distorted by the thing&rsquo;s strange existence. It sat there, waiting. I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend what I was looking at. Part of it began to shift and a section of the amorphous body around the ghostly green light began to bulge forward. The bulge resolved itself into a thick, serpentine neck, at the end of which was perched an ancient, crumbling skull. Clinging to the remains of the lower jaw was an impossibly long beard that dangled nearly to the smooth flagstones of the causeway. The green point of light danced maddeningly between the empty sockets, the jaw hanging open in an eternal, gap-toothed leer.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;Why have you come?&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>The voice was deep, resonant. It felt more like a vibration deep within my bones than something I could actually hear.
            
                  <br></br>I swallowed, trying to find words. The green light continued its maniacal dance.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;I came...I came because I had to know if the legends were true.&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>For a long time, the creature sat, silently contemplating.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;If he is not careful, a man can become consumed by his obsessions.&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>I nodded. The thing made a sweeping gesture with one of its massive arms, indicating the silent monuments that stretched in all directions from where we stood.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;This...this is all the obsession of one man. One man who could never understand the price of his grief. Do you have any idea what was lost because of this place?&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>The creature shook its head, the beard swishing against the stone of the causeway with a nearly imperceptible rustle.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t. I have spent millennia building this. I watched my city degenerate into decadence and darkness and I still would not raise a finger to stop it. The worst sin of it all is that each of these tombs lies empty. She rests somewhere far from here, her bones long ago turned to dust. And yet the tombs still grow. I thought I could quench the fires of my grief by creating monuments to it. And I did...for nearly a thousand years. As my people killed each other in the streets, as unspeakable rituals were carried out in my city...I built shrines to loss, to a woman who had discarded my love...It was only after the city stood empty for nearly two hundred years that I began to understand the true costs of what I had done. I let my city die. I gave up my humanity long before I became the thing you see before you. But I keep building the tombs. I journey into the corpse of my city and take from it, only to build here. But these tombs are no longer for her. These are the monuments to what I let be lost. These are the tombs of my people, of my city. Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair.&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>I stood, speechless. And suddenly that tickle of a thought from the day before made sense. I had seen the evidence of the creature&rsquo;s thefts all over the city. Excised chunks of rock from buildings, missing statuary. Never could I have imagined what those things meant, that this creature who believed itself to be King Zydmainados was slowly demolishing one city to build another. It began speaking again, the deep rumble of its voice snapping me from my fevered thoughts.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;And what do you plan to do now that you have found my city? Return from whence you came and tell the world of your discovery?&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>I swallowed.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;I cannot let that happen.&rdquo; The creature rumbled. &ldquo;You are not the first man to find his way here, nor will you be the last.&rdquo;
             
                  <br></br>I tensed, my hand dropping to the hilt of my dagger.
             
                  <br></br>&ldquo;Relax, traveler. I have no interest in harming you. Your weapon would do little to save you if I did. This city keeps its own secrets. It is cursed, as I am cursed, as you are now as well. Once you set foot outside its gates, you will slowly forget how you found your way here. It will be years before you forget entirely, but the curse will take it, one piece at a time, in much the same way that I am dismantling the city, one piece at a time...until all that is left are the dreams of this place which you will half-remember upon waking and weave into stories to tell children in the bazaar. May your return journey be a safe one, traveller.&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>With a sound like a great rushing of wind, the creature was gone. I stood, alone on the causeway for a long time, unable to truly comprehend the events, which had just transpired, and the message conveyed by the sole spirit haunting a long dead city.

                  <br></br>&ldquo;Boy! Yes, you, boy! Come here for a moment.&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>The child stopped outside the shadowy tent of the incense seller, unable to fully glimpse the man at the back of the tent&rsquo;s hazy interior.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;Have you ever heard tell of the great tomb city, lost out among the sands and centuries of time?&rdquo;
            
                  <br></br>The boy nervously shook his head.
            
                  <br></br>&ldquo;Well, boy, business is slow, the sun is hot, and I have stories to tell...come in...&rdquo;
