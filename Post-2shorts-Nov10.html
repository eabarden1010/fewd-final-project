			<h4>Gulls</h4><div class="small-line-list">___</div><div class="post-date-list">November 10, 2016</div>
			<p><p class="section-p">We pulled into the lot near the carousel and got out of the truck. A handful of seagulls scattered. Papa put the tailgate down, causing a miniature snowstorm of rust. I clambered up onto the pale blue metal, dotted here and there with dents and dings accumulated over the years. He sat down, handing me my burger (ketchup only) from the bag.The gulls were back. I could smell the lake, but couldn&rsquo;t see it from where we sat. Leftover fries were fed, one by one, to the waiting gulls. On days like this, it&rsquo;s those days I miss most.</p>

                  <h4>Lucky Star</h4><div class="small-line-list">___</div><div class="post-date-list">November 10, 2016</div>
                  <p><p class="section-p"> The man stank of death. Though if he was already dead or merely on the way, I couldn&rsquo;t tell. It didn&rsquo;t matter. Whatever he drank was guaranteed to kill him, but we were there to see it to the end. My hair in braids. Red panties. The body slumped, oozing onto the rug. We sat and I passed Amelia the flask. She drank it down, our names disappearing with the alcohol. SWAT on the rickety metal steps of the Shooting Star Motel. Time slowed. Two knocks. It was over, as we had known it would be from the very beginning.</p>
